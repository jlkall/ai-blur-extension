# CloseAI Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 19, 2024

## Overview

CloseAI is a browser extension that detects and blurs AI-generated content using local machine learning models. This privacy policy explains how CloseAI handles user data.

## Data Collection

**CloseAI does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

All processing happens entirely locally in your browser. No data is sent to external servers, third parties, or any remote services.

## How CloseAI Works

- The extension analyzes web page content locally using machine learning models
- Text and images are processed in your browser using bundled ML models
- Detection results are displayed only in your browser
- No data is collected, stored, or transmitted

## Permissions

CloseAI requires access to all websites to detect AI-generated content. This permission is used solely for:
- Analyzing page content to identify AI-generated text and images
- Displaying blur effects and confidence ratings locally
- Modifying Google search queries to prevent AI overviews

**This access does not involve:**
- Data collection
- Data transmission
- External network requests
- User tracking

## Third-Party Services

CloseAI does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or data collection services.

## Data Storage

CloseAI stores minimal local data in your browser:
- Cache of detection scores (to avoid redundant processing)
- This cache is stored locally and never transmitted

## Updates

If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be posted here with a new "Last Updated" date.
